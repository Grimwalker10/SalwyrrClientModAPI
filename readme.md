# Salwyrr Client Mod API (Fork of Badlion Client Mod API)

To facilitate the configuration of the mods that you want to disable on your server, we have chosen to use the Badlion API already used by many servers.
If you already have this API on your server, no additional configuration is required.

This repository is only used to list the values compatible with the Salwyrr Client, we have some mods that Badlion does not have, or on the contrary some Badlion API values will be ignored since some mods does not exist on our client or is not yet compatible with this API for various reasons.

For example the value corresponding to the ToggleSneak in the inventory will be ignored by our client, because by default our client does not allow users to use the ToggleSneak while they are in an interface/inventory.

### Installation

We invite you to search the installation or configuration information directly on the original repository.

### Mod Names and Fields that can be disabled

Values will be added as we add mods compatible with this API.
